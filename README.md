Qumulo Directory Capacity Trends

In this tutorial, we will show you how to install InfluxDB on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. 

### Prerequisites
* Ubuntu 22.04
* Itâ€™s recommended that you use a fresh OS install to prevent any potential issues.
* SSH access to the server.

### Install InfluxDB on Ubuntu 22.04

__Step 1.__ First, make sure that all your system packages are up-to-date by running the following apt commands in the terminal.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install wget apt-transport-https gnupg2 software-properties-common
```
__Step 2.__ Installing InfluxDB on Ubuntu 22.04.

By default, InfluxDB is not available on Ubuntu 22.04 base repository. Now install the add InfluxDB PPA repository to your system using the following command:

```
echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/influxdb.gpg] https://repos.influxdata.com/debian stable main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/influxdata.list
```
Next, import the GPG key:
```
wget -q https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdb.key
echo '23a1c8836f0afc5ed24e0486339d7cc8f6790b83886c4c96995b88a061c5bb5d influxdb.key' | sha256sum -c && cat influxdb.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/influxdb.gpg > /dev/null
```

After the repository has been added successfully, you can then proceed to install InfluxDB on Ubuntu using the command shown in the output below:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install influxdb2
```

Once successfully installed, Start and enable the service to start on bootup:

```
sudo systemctl enable --now influxdb
sudo systemctl start influxdb
```
__Step 3.__ Configure InfluxDB Database and User Credentials.
Now run the following command to perform the initial configuration for Influx:
```
influx setup
```
Output:
```
> Welcome to InfluxDB 2.0!
? Please type your primary username qumulo
? Please type your password ************
? Please type your password again ************
? Please type your primary organization name Qumulo
? Please type your primary bucket name Qumulo
? Please type your retention period in hours, or 0 for infinite 2160
? Setup with these parameters?
  Username:          qumulo
  Organization:      Qumulo
  Bucket:            Qumulo
  Retention Period:  2160h0m0s
 Yes
User    Organization    Bucket
qumulo  Qumulo          Qumulo
```
Your details are stored in the __/home/username/.influxdbv2/configs__ file.

__Step 4.__ Configure Firewall.

Now we set up an Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) with InfluxDB to allow public access on default web ports __8086__:
```
sudo ufw allow 8086/tcp
sudo ufw enable
```
__Step 5.__ Accessing InfluxDB Web Interface.

Once successfully installed, now open a web browser and go to __http://your-IP-address:8086__ 

__Step 6.__ Checking InfluxDB Token details.
Your details are stored in the __/home/username/.influxdbv2/configs__ file. Open this file to learn your default user Token.
```
cat /home/username/.influxdbv2/configs
[default]
  url = "http://localhost:8086"
  token = "5CdgSRfAwm3Mt37yuO_P5Pf1Y7hFLdaPlMU8o4sP2BD........=="
  org = "Qumulo"
  active = true
```
### Preparing of the Python scripts

__Step 1.__ First, before you can run the Python scripts, you will need to clone this repository on your machine. For that, you will need to have `git` installed on your machine.
```
apt install git
```

__Step 2.__ Create `qumulo` directory under `/opt` directory. Move that `/opt/qumulo` directory. Download the repository inside this directory. 
```
mkdir /opt/qumulo
cd /opt/qumulo
git clone https://github.com/BeratUlualan/DirectoryTrends.git
```

__Step 3.__ Install the required Python libraries. You will need Internet access from the machine for this step.
```
apt install python3-pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

__Step 4.__ Edit the configuration file according the configurations of your Qumulo cluster and InfluxDB environment.
```
nano config/config.json 
```

```
{
        "cluster" : {
                "address" : "CLUSTER_ADDRESS",
        "port" : "8000",
                "username" : "",
                "password" : "",
        "access_token": "QUMULO_ACCESS_TOKEN"
        },
    "influxdb" : {
        "address" : "INFLUXDB_ADRESS",
        "token" : "INFLUXDB_TOKEN",
        "bucket_name" : "BUCKET_NAME"
    },
    "email":{
        "from": "from@mail.com",
        "to": "to@mail.com",
        "login": "",
        "password": "",
        "server": "SMTP_SERVER_ADDRESS",
        "port": 25,
        "use": "none"
    },
    "directories": {
        "dir_paths": ["/Dir1","/Dir2"],
        "max_depth": 0
    }
}
```

__access_token__ : [Check Qumulo Access Token Details] (https://docs.qumulo.com/administrator-guide/external-services/using-access-tokens.html)

__token__ : [Check InfluxDB Token Details] (https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/cloud/security/tokens/create-token/)

__bucket_name__ : InfluxDB bucket name

Email options:
* __from__ - From email address
* __to__ - An email address of an individual or group
* __login__ - Username needed to login to the email server
* __password__ - Password needed to login to the email server

__dir_paths__ : The Qumulo file system paths of the directories that you want to monitor

__max_depth__ : If you want to monitor sub-directories of the defined directories in __dir_paths__ option, set it __1__. Otherwise, you can set __0__.

__Step 5.__ Test your scripts.
